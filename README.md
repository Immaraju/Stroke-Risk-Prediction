# ML-Based Stroke Risk Prediction

## 🏥 Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a **Machine Learning model** that predicts the risk of stroke based on a set of medical attributes. This model aims to assist in **early diagnosis and intervention**, potentially improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

## 📌 Dataset
The project uses the **Heart Disease dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. The dataset consists of multiple patient records, each with medical attributes like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and smoking status.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training using **Logistic Regression**
- Performance evaluation using accuracy
